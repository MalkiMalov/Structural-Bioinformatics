# Structural Bioinformatics
Structural bioinformatics is the branch of bioinformatics that is related to the analysis and prediction of the three-dimensional structure of biological macromolecules such as proteins, RNA, and DNA.
Here I implement some known algorithms and calculations on proteins, with the Bio python package.

✨ **Peptides_classifier NN:** This program uses neural networks to predict which peptide is an epitope.
The epitopes are foreign peptides (small proteins) that take part in the immune-system activity. 

✨ **PI-Calculation:** The PI (Point Isoelectric) value is the point when the protein has no charge.

✨ **Radius of Gyration:** Calculate with the root mean square distance from each atom of the protein to their centroid.
